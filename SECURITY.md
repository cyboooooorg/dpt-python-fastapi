# Security

I take the security of my projects seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our software, I encourage you to let me know right away. I will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to me through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to <martin.crampon@hotmail.fr>.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
